# Mergesort Algorithm

The array is recursively divided into smaller subarrays until each subarray has a size of 1, which is inherently sorted. The subarrays are then merged in a way that maintains order, resulting in larger sorted arrays. This merging process continues until all the subarrays are combined into a single, fully sorted array.

# Bubblesort Algorithm

The array is iteratively processed multiple times, with each pass comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This process pushes the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the array during each pass. Subsequent passes ignore the already sorted portion of the array, focusing only on the unsorted elements. This continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is fully sorted.
