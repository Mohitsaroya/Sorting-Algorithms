#Mergesort Algorithms

The array is recursively divided into smaller subarrays until each subarray has a size of 1, which is inherently sorted. The subarrays are then merged in a way that maintains order, resulting in larger sorted arrays. This merging process continues until all the subarrays are combined into a single, fully sorted array.
